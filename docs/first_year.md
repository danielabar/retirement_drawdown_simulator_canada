# First Year of RRSP Withdrawals Explainer

There is a nuance with RRSP withdrawals that can result in a cash shortfall for retiree's first year. This document explains the issue and a solution.

The problem applies to:
1. Those whose desired after-tax spending plus TFSA contribution lands in under the 30% [federal and provincial tax brackets](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html).
2. There are no other sources of income besides RRSP withdrawals (i.e. no CPP, OAS, other pension income, etc.)

For example, suppose your desired after tax spending in retirement is `$40,000` and you also wish to make a TFSA contribution each year of `$7,000`, for a total spend of `$47,000`. This would place you in the 15% federal and 5.05% provincial tax bracket in Ontario, as of 2025.

In order to have an after-tax income of `$47,000`, you actually have to withdraw more from your RRSP to account for the taxes, because RRSP withdrawals count as regular income. Use a [tax calculator](https://www.eytaxcalculators.com/en/2025-personal-tax-calculator.html) to experiment with different withdrawal amounts (e.g., `$50,000`, `$55,000`) until you reach your target after-tax income.


For example, withdrawing `$55,100` in 2025 would yield an After-Tax Income of `$47,025` in Ontario, which is an average tax rate of 14.66% and a marginal tax rate of 24.15%. Your income tax bill would be `$8,075`.

However, financial institutions are obligated by law to [withhold tax on RRSP withdrawals](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/making-withdrawals/tax-rates-on-withdrawals.html), kind of like how an employer deducts taxes from your regular pay during your working years.

Withdrawals over `$15,000` will have 30% withheld. This is bat-sh*& crazy given that if that were your only source of income, you would pay little to no income tax because that's the [basic personal amount](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/federal-government-budgets/basic-personal-amount.html). This means you would have to wait until March of next year when filing your taxes to get a refund, but in the meantime, you don't have your own money!

Back to our example of desired after tax spending of `$47,000` requiring a withdrawal of `$55,100`. Suppose you make this withdrawal on Jan. 1 to fund your living expenses and TFSA contribution for the year. The financial institution will withhold 30% of that which is `$55,100 * 0.3 = $16,530`. So you will only be left with `$38,570`. But remember your spending needs are `$47,000`, which leaves a shortfall of `$47,000 - $38,570 = $8,430`.

One solution to this is before you pull the trigger on retirement, save up an additional `$8,430` in something liquid like a chequing or savings account to cover the expected shortfall. Then use this, in addition to your RRSP withdrawal after withholding tax, to fund your first year of retirement spending.

Then in March of the following year when you file your taxes, your actual tax bill will only be `$8,075`, which means you'll get a refund of the difference between what the institution withheld and what you actually owe, which is: `$16,530 - $8,075 = $8,455`.

Take that `$8,455` refund and again place it in a liquid account. That, in addition to what's left of second year RRSP withdrawal minus withholding tax, will fund the next year's retirement, and so on, until the RRSP account is drained.

## Notes:

- Withholding tax is not necessarily the final tax bill, just a prepayment.
- Withholding tax applies per withdrawal, not annually. You could attempt to reduce withholding tax by taking out smaller chunks throughout the year but some institutions charge a withdrawal fee, and this increases overall administrative burden.
