# Experimenting with the typical FIRE scenario:
# 1M portfolio, 40K/year, retire early based on 4% rule.
# Success rate is only ~40% if starting at age 35 (no CPP),
# Not the 95% that's often reported in FIRE blogs.
# Even with a 1-year cash cushion to use during a market downturn.
# With CPP delayed to 70, success rate goes up to ~50%, still not great.
