# Retirement Drawdown Simulator üá®üá¶

A retirement drawdown calculator for Canadians. It simulates how long your savings might last in retirement, assuming you have three accounts (RRSP, taxable, and TFSA) holding some broadly diversified ETFs or index funds for which you can specify an average market return.

Features include:

1. Withdraw from RRSP first, accounting for federal and provincial income taxes.
2. Withdraw from Taxable account next.
3. Withdraw from TFSA last.
4. Withdrawals from multiple accounts are combined if there's not quite enough in one account, but there is in the next account.
5. Optionally you can choose to make a TFSA contribution during the years that the RRSP and taxable accounts are being drawn down, in an attempt to maximize tax free withdrawals later in life (and minimize mandatory RRIF withdrawals after age 71).
6. Optionally if you specify a cash cushion (i.e. amount of savings you have in an easily accessible liquid account like a high interest savings account), then the simulation will drawdown from the cash cushion rather than investment accounts during periods of market downturns.
7. Optionally you can specify at what age you plan to take CPP and your monthly entitlement amount. In this case the simulator will reduce your withdrawals accordingly, including factoring in that both RRSP withdrawals and CPP count as taxable income.
8. Mandatory RRIF withdrawals starting at age 71, according to these [rates](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/completing-slips-summaries/t4rsp-t4rif-information-returns/payments/chart-prescribed-factors.html). If the mandatory withdrawal is greater than what you would have wanted to take out, then the after-tax amount is deposited into the taxable account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> RRSP withdrawals are treated as income and subject to federal and provincial income tax. This project does a reverse tax calculation, to determine what amount you actually need to withdraw from RRSP to achieve desired spending (and optional TFSA contribution) amount. This is often overlooked in FIRE/retirement calculators. For example, if you want to spend `$40,000` from your RRSP in Ontario, as of 2025 tax rates, you'd have to withdraw approximately `$46,200`.

It also models your first year of RRSP withdrawal and why you may need an additional cash buffer to cover some shortfall. See [First Year Shortfall](docs/first_year.md) for further details.

You can also run the same scenario over and over with different options for randomized returns, to see what your chances of success are.

## Why I Built This

When I started looking for a basic tool to simulate a retirement drawdown in Canada, I couldn‚Äôt find anything ‚Äî just advice to hire a financial planner. While professional guidance is valuable, a free, transparent tool should exist for those who want to see how long their savings might last under a relatively simple withdrawal strategy.

### Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This tool is for **informational and educational purposes only**. It does **not** constitute financial, tax, or investment advice. The calculations are based on **simplified assumptions** and **may not reflect your actual financial situation**. You should consult with a **qualified financial professional** before making any retirement, investment, or other financial decisions. Use this tool at your own risk.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby version installed as per `.ruby-version`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/danielabar/retirement-simulator.git
   cd retirement-simulator
   ```

Or download and extract the [project zip file](https://github.com/danielabar/retirement_drawdown_simulator_canada/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

### Setup

1. Copy the template file:

   ```sh
   cp inputs.yml.template inputs.yml
   ```

2. Edit `inputs.yml` and enter your actual financial details.

   - The template file (`inputs.yml.template`) contains example values.
   - Open `inputs.yml` in a text editor and replace the values with your actual financial information.

### Running the Simulation

Run the script with:

```sh
ruby main.rb
```

The output will display a table showing account balances each year until depletion, and whether your plan was successful or failed.

Or to run the simulation multiple times to see what percentage of scenarios are successful, run:

```sh
ruby main.rb success_rate
```

## Configuration

Your financial inputs are stored in `inputs.yml`. Below is an example:

```yaml
# Mode can be 'detailed' for a single run with detailed output, or 'success_rate'
mode: detailed

# For success_rate mode
total_runs: 1000

# Age at which you plan to start retirement
retirement_age: 65

# Maximum age to run the simulation until.
# This prevents infinite loops if investment growth outpaces withdrawals.
# Choose a reasonable upper bound based on longevity estimates,
# but note that this is just for the simulation and not a personal prediction.
max_age: 95

# Province or territory where you reside
# Valid values are: ONT, NL, PE, NS, NB, MB, SK, AB, BC, YT, NT, NU
province_code: ONT

# Success factor: defines the multiplier for total_balance needed by max_age for success.
# Supports fractional, eg: 1.5
success_factor: 1

# Growth rate average, min, and max to generate variability
# Enter the "real" return rather than nominal as inflation isn't handled currently.
# For example if you're invested in broad market index funds or ETF's and using
# an average return of 8%, but inflation is around 3%, then put 5% real return here.
# The min and max are to constrain volatility. For example the market has dropped
# by 30% and has grown by that much as well.
# Set a downturn_threshold so if market return is below this amount, use cash_cushion.
annual_growth_rate:
  average: 0.05
  min: -0.3
  max: 0.3
  downturn_threshold: -0.2

# Choose the return sequence generator: mean, geometric_brownian_motion, constant
# If using `success_rate` mode, then choose either `mean` or `geometric_brownian_motion`
# `constant` returns are conceptually easy to understand, and produce pleasing predictable results,
# but are unrealistic as the market doesn't actually do this.
return_sequence_type: geometric_brownian_motion

# Optionally continue to make TFSA contributions during RRSP and Taxable drawdown phases
# If you don't want to make any TFSA contributions during drawdown, set this to 0.
annual_tfsa_contribution: 0

# After tax amount you need per year in retirement (NOT including TFSA contribution, this is your spending number).
# To get an accurate number here, you should track your spending for at least a year
# Or review a year's worth of past credit card statements and other sources of spending.
# Add up:
#   1. Variable spending (groceries, personal, entertainment, travel, etc.)
#   2. Fixed spending (any constant recurring payments)
#   3. Lumpy (eg: new car, replace roof, replace appliances etc. only happen every few years so divide amount by how many years expense occurs)
desired_spending: 40000

# Starting account balances.
# The cash_cushion will be used in case of market downturns (value you set earlier in downturn_threshold).
# Set cash_cushion balance to 0 if you don't want to use it or don't have a cash cushion.
accounts:
  rrsp: 600000
  taxable: 200000
  tfsa: 200000
  cash_cushion: 40000

# Enter the age at which you plan to start CPP and the monthly amount you're entitled to.
# You can find this value by logging in to your My Service Canada account.
# The values shown in My Service Canada assume you continue to work at your current income
# up until the age you start taking CPP.
# If you're planning on retiring earlier than this, then your actual CPP numbers will be
# lower due to those additional years of no contributions.
# In this case, use https://research-tools.pwlcapital.com/research/cpp to estimate what you may actually get.
# To run the simulation without CPP, set the monthly_amount to 0.
cpp:
  start_age: 65
  monthly_amount: 0

# Taxes
# Withholding tax may be greater than your actual tax bill, you'll get a refund when you file your taxes.
# In the first year of retirement, you'll have to have some extra cash available to "float" the difference.
# In subsequent years, the previous year's tax refund will be used to fund part of next years spending.
# RRSP Withholding tax: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/making-withdrawals/tax-rates-on-withdrawals.html
# Assumption is you'll be withdrawing at least 15K which lands in 30% withholding tax.
taxes:
  rrsp_withholding_rate: 0.3
```

## Sample Output

Here's a run using `inputs.yml` copied from `inputs.yml.template` with a successful result - i.e. money lasts from a starting retirement age of 65 until `max_age` of 95, with at least 1x desired_income left. The desired_income of `$40,000` is 4% of the total starting balance of `$1,000,000` (which is divided among RRSP, taxable, and TFSA accounts). i.e. this is the 4% rule over a thirty year retirement period. There's also 1 year's worth of spending set aside in a cash cushion for use in case of a severe market downturn, which gets used at age 67.

If there's not enough in one account for the full year's spending, it will combine withdrawals from multiple accounts. For example, at age 82 it combines what's left of the RRSP, with some from taxable.

Also note since the RRSP balance is drained relatively quickly from a combination of desired spending and optional TFSA contribution, by the time mandatory RRIF withdrawals start at age 71, the required percentage of the remaining balance is less than what this user would have withdrawn in any case, so there's never any excess forced withdrawal.

```
ruby main.rb
```

![demo success](docs/images/demo_success.png "demo success")

Here's another successful run with higher returns in the person's mid 80s that cause the RRSP balance to grow more. In this case, the mandatory RRIF rates by that age age greater than what the person needed to withdraw, resulting in an after-tax excess which gets deposited into the taxable account. This is shown as a positive RRIF Excess starting at age 84.

![demo success rrif](docs/images/demo_success_rrif.png "demo success rrif")

Here's a run where a bad initial sequence of returns causes the money to run out by age 84. The market downturn threshold is set to -20% so you can see at age 76 that the cash cushion is being used, but that's not enough to save this scenario.

```
ruby main.rb
```

![demo failure](docs/images/demo_failure.png "demo failure")

### Determining Your Success Rate

You can use the `success_rate` mode (either specify it in `inputs.yml` or override it at the command line as shown below) to run the simulation many times over. In this case, it calculates the percentage of successful scenarios. For example, this shows that the 4% withdrawal rate over a thirty year period has about a `78%` success rate, rather than the `95%` rate that's often reported in personal finance articles (which is based on US historical data):

```
ruby main.rb success_rate
```

![demo success rate](docs/images/demo_success_rate.png "demo success rate")

Success is defined as making it to `max_age` with at least `success_factor` * annual withdrawals in that phase, money left.

For example, suppose `max_age` is `105`, `desired_spending` is `40000` and success_factor is `1.5`. Then if the scenario shows that there's still 40000 * 1.5 = `$60,000` left by age `105`, this is considered a success.

> [!NOTE]
> The 4% rule research considers reaching the end of life with even just `$1.00` a "success". Realistically, most people would be freaking out if they were getting on in their 90's and their account balance was dwindling down like that.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Keep `inputs.yml` Private

Since `inputs.yml` contains personal financial information, it is **ignored by Git** (see `.gitignore`).
**Do not commit it** to avoid exposing sensitive data.
