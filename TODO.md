# TODO

- summary section is a little confusing
- add column showing net worth
- inflation
- assuming constant rate of return
- Assuming all accounts invested in the same thing, therefore growing at the same rate
- RRSP withdrawal fee?
- TFSA withdrawal fee?
- ETF selling commission?
- Start CPP at age 60, 65, or 70: https://research-tools.pwlcapital.com/research/cpp (complexity: amount shown on My Service Canada assumes you keep working until age 65, if retiring early, actual amount will be less, the PWL research tool attempts to account for that by having you enter all your earnings over the past years)
- During RRSP drawdown phase, taxable account is growing, and distributions are taxable (T3 issued)
- What if you reach age 71 and there's still funds in RRSP -> forced to RRIF and minimum withdrawals
- Ignoring complexity of partial withdrawals - a little left in one account but not enough to fund that years spending so have to go to next account
