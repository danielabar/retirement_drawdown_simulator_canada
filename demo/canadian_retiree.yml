# Canadian retiree variant of the 4% rule: same $1,000,000 portfolio and $40,000/year
# spending, but with a typical CPP benefit (~$800/month). The average Canadian taking
# CPP at 65 receives roughly $750-$900/month — very few reach the maximum (~$1,300/month).
# Compare success rate to demo/four_percent_rule.yml to see how CPP changes the picture.
