# FIRE scenario: same as demo/fire_3pct_modest_cpp.yml but retiring at 50 instead
# of 45 — 5 more years of work. Same portfolio ($1,333,333) and 3% withdrawal rate
# ($40,000/year) to isolate the effect of the shorter retirement horizon and the
# extra CPP entitlement that comes from working longer.
#
# CPP assumption: ~$650/month at age 65.
#   With 25 years of median-income contributions (~$55,000/year, roughly 75% of the
#   YMPE), a rough estimate is: $1,364 × 0.75 × (25/39) ≈ $655/month. We use $650
#   as a round number. The gap before CPP starts is also shorter — 15 years instead
#   of 20 — which means the portfolio carries the full load for less time before
#   guaranteed income kicks in.
