# FIRE version of demo/cash_cushion_with.yml: same $40,000 spending and total portfolio
# ($1,183,000), but retiring at 45 (50-year horizon) with 100% equity returns and modest
# CPP of $500/month at 65. The portfolio carries the full $40K/year load for 20 years
# before CPP arrives.
#
# The question: does the cash cushion matter more or less over a 50-year horizon with
# higher volatility (100% equity)? Compare to demo/cash_cushion_fire_without.yml.
