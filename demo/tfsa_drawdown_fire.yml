# FIRE scenario: same $40,000 spending and 3.5% withdrawal rate as demo/tfsa_drawdown_40k.yml,
# but retiring at 45 (50-year horizon) with 100% equity returns and modest CPP at 65.
#
# CPP assumption: ~$500/month at 65, based on ~20 years of median-income contributions
# (same as demo/fire_3pct_modest_cpp.yml). The portfolio carries the full $40K/year for
# 20 years before CPP kicks in.
#
# Compare to demo/tfsa_drawdown_fire_contrib.yml to see if TFSA contributions matter more
# over a 50-year horizon than they did in the 30-year standard retirement case.
