# Same as demo/cash_cushion_with.yml but the $40,000 cash cushion is moved into the
# investable accounts instead — $1,183,000 fully invested, no cash buffer.
# Accounts keep the same 60/20/20 RRSP/Taxable/TFSA split as the cushion scenario.
#
# Total money is identical to demo/cash_cushion_with.yml ($1,183,000). The only
# difference is whether $40K sits in cash or stays invested.
