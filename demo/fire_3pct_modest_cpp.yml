# FIRE scenario at a 3% withdrawal rate with a modest CPP estimate.
#
# Portfolio: $1,333,333 — the amount needed for $40,000/year at a 3% withdrawal rate
# ($40,000 / 0.03). Retiring at 45, 50-year horizon, 100% global equity.
#
# CPP assumption: ~$500/month at age 65.
#   Someone retiring at 45 after ~20 years of median-income work (~$55,000/year)
#   would have contributed to CPP from roughly age 25 to 45. The maximum CPP (2024)
#   is ~$1,364/month and requires ~39 years at the maximum pensionable earnings.
#   With 20 years of contributions at roughly 75% of the earnings ceiling, a rough
#   estimate is: $1,364 × 0.75 × (20/39) ≈ $525/month. We use $500/month as a
#   conservative round number. This is a rough estimate — actual entitlement depends
#   on your specific contribution history. Use Service Canada's online estimator or
#   https://research-tools.pwlcapital.com/research/cpp for a personal projection.
