# Canadian retiree baseline: $35,000/year spending at a 3.5% withdrawal rate.
# Portfolio of $1,000,000 is sized so that $35,000 represents exactly 3.5%
# ($35,000 / 0.035). CPP $800/month at 65. No TFSA contribution during drawdown.
# Lower spending means lower taxable income each year — a lower marginal tax bracket
# than the $40K scenario. Used in docs/insights/tfsa_contributions_during_drawdown.md
# to explore whether tax bracket affects the value of TFSA contributions.
# Compare to demo/tfsa_drawdown_35k_contrib.yml.
