# Same as demo/tfsa_drawdown_40k.yml but with a $7,000/year TFSA contribution
# during the RRSP drawdown phase. The contribution is on top of the $40,000
# spending, so the portfolio must fund $47,000/year equivalent — meaning a larger
# gross RRSP withdrawal each year (since RRSP withdrawals are taxable income).
# Compare success rate and percentiles to demo/tfsa_drawdown_40k.yml.
