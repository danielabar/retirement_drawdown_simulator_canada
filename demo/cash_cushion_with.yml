# Standard retirement: $40,000/year spending, 3.5% withdrawal rate, Canadian retiree with
# CPP. Investable portfolio of $1,143,000 (RRSP + Taxable + TFSA) plus a $40,000 cash
# cushion (1 year of spending) on top — $1,183,000 total.
#
# The cash cushion activates when the annual market return falls below -10%. Compare to
# demo/cash_cushion_without.yml, which puts the same $1,183,000 entirely into invested
# accounts with no cushion.
