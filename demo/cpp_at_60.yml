# CPP timing comparison — taking CPP at the earliest possible age (60).
# $1,000,000 portfolio ($600K RRSP / $200K Taxable / $200K TFSA) plus a $40,000 cash cushion,
# retiring at 60 with $40,000/year spending, running to 95 (35-year horizon), Ontario.
# CPP at 60 pays $896/month — lower monthly income, but it starts immediately.
# Compare to demo/cpp_at_65.yml and demo/cpp_at_70.yml.
