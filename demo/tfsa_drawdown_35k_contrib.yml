# Same as demo/tfsa_drawdown_35k.yml but with a $7,000/year TFSA contribution.
# At $35,000 spending, the total annual draw becomes $42,000 equivalent — still a
# relatively modest income level that may stay in a lower marginal tax bracket than
# the $40K + $7K = $47K equivalent in the higher-spending scenario.
# The question: does a lower tax bracket make TFSA contributions during drawdown
# more worthwhile? Compare to demo/tfsa_drawdown_35k.yml.
